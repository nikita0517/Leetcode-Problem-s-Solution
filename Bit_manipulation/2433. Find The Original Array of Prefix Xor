/*
pref[i] = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i]
Since pref is the prefix array,
it's calculated from arr one by one,
we can doing this process reverssely to recover the original array.

Since
pref[i] = pref[i-1] ^ A[i]
so we have
pref[i] ^ pref[i-1] = A[i]

So we simply change - to ^ in the intuition solution

The reverse operation of + is -
The reverse operation of ^ is still ^
More general, we can apply this solution to prefix of any operation.
